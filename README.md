# Understanding Long-Term ODSP Reliance Across Ontario CMAs
A Policy-Focused Data Analysis & Forecasting Project

## 📌 Purpose
The Ontario Disability Support Program (ODSP) plays a critical role in supporting individuals with long-term disabilities. However, ODSP system pressure is shaped not only by caseload size, but also by how long recipients remain on assistance.

This project examines:

- How average time on ODSP has evolved over the past two decades
- How regional differences across Census Metropolitan Areas (CMAs) contribute to long-term system burden
- Whether demographic composition explains persistent regional differences
- Which CMAs may be structurally at higher risk of sustained long-term ODSP reliance

## 🎯 Key policy questions
This analysis addresses five policy-relevant questions:

1. How has average ODSP duration changed over time?
2. How has total caseload growth interacted with duration trends?
3. Which CMAs contribute most to long-term ODSP system pressure and why?
4. Do household and demographic compositions explain regional persistence?
5.Which CMAs may face elevated risk of sustained long-term reliance going forward?
