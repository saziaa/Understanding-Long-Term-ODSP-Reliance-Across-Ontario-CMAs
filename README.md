# Understanding Long-Term ODSP Reliance Across Ontario CMAs
A Policy-Focused Data Analysis & Forecasting Project

## 📌 Purpose
The Ontario Disability Support Program (ODSP) plays a critical role in supporting individuals with long-term disabilities. However, ODSP system pressure is shaped not only by caseload size, but also by how long recipients remain on assistance.

This project examines:

- How average time on ODSP has evolved over the past two decades
- How regional differences across Census Metropolitan Areas (CMAs) contribute to long-term system burden
- Whether demographic composition explains persistent regional differences
- Which CMAs may be structurally at higher risk of sustained long-term ODSP reliance

## 🎯 Key policy questions
This analysis addresses five policy-relevant questions:

1. How has average ODSP duration changed over time?
2. How has total caseload growth interacted with duration trends?
3. Which CMAs contribute most to long-term ODSP system pressure and why?
4. Do household and demographic compositions explain regional persistence?
5. Which CMAs may face elevated risk of sustained long-term reliance going forward?

## 🛢️ Data Overview

- **Source**: Government of Canada – Open Data Portal  
- **Coverage**: 2003–2024  
- **Geography**: 15 Census Metropolitan Areas (CMAs) in Ontario  

This analysis uses aggregated ODSP administrative data to examine **regional patterns of long-term program reliance**. The dataset captures both the **scale of participation** and the **persistence of ODSP use** across Ontario’s major urban labour markets.

Key variables are structured to reflect **policy-relevant dimensions of long-term dependency**, including:

- **Duration on ODSP**, grouped into short-, medium-, and long-term participation (0–35 months, 36–59 months, 60+ months)
- **Total caseload size**, to distinguish volume-driven system pressure from duration-driven persistence
- **Household composition** (single adults, couples, single-parent households), reflecting differences in employment barriers and support needs
- **Age group distribution** (≤24, 25–54, 55+), capturing life-cycle and labour-market attachment effects
- **Family size indicators**, proxying caregiving responsibilities and household complexity
- **Gender composition**, reflecting known gender differences in disability prevalence and labour force participation

All analysis is conducted at the **CMA level**. No individual-level or identifiable data are used.

## 🔑 Key Findings

1️⃣ **ODSP duration has increased even as caseload growth stabilized**

Average time on ODSP declined in the early 2000s, stabilized through the early 2010s, and has increased steadily since 2015. Importantly, this increase continued even after overall caseload growth slowed, suggesting rising long-term reliance among existing recipients.

2️⃣ **Regional system pressure is driven by different mechanisms**

CMAs were grouped using two dimensions:
- Average duration on ODSP
- Cumulative contribution to system case-months

This revealed four structurally distinct CMA profiles:
- High volume, moderate duration (e.g., large urban centres)
- Lower volume, high duration (smaller CMAs with persistent reliance)
- High duration and high contribution (structural persistence hotspots)
- Lower duration and contribution (comparative benchmarks)

3️⃣ **Demographic composition varies surprisingly little across CMAs**

Across all CMA segments:
- Single-adult households dominate ODSP participation (~80%)
- Working-age adults (25–54) represent the majority of recipients
- Family size and household structure distributions are highly consistent
